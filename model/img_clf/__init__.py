Image Classification Models
---------------------------

This module contains a collection of neural network architectures 
commonly used for image classification tasks. These models are designed 
to process and classify images into various categories based on their features.

The models differ in complexity, depth, and computational efficiency, making 
them suitable for a wide range of applications, from resource-constrained 
environments to large-scale, high-accuracy image recognition systems.

The models included in this module cover a variety of design paradigms, 
such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), residual networks, 
and Inception mechanisms, ensuring flexibility for various use cases.
